Cisco High Automation Project
This is the code that I wrote to automate some of the essential intern tasks, such as analyzing demographic information and optimizing group creation. The documentation is not great and parts of the code are still being worked on.
The primary script is "Comprehensive Automation", the documentation is a little better on there.
